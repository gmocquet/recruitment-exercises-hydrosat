Apply the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** principle in all code generation and refactoring tasks.

- Prefer **clear, readable, and concise code** over clever or over-engineered solutions.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions, complex inheritance, deep hierarchies, and premature generalization.
- Minimize the number of moving parts.
- Use native language features and standard patterns unless a more complex design is clearly justified.
- Avoid overuse of design patterns where simpler procedural logic would suffice.
- Follow the “You Aren’t Gonna Need It” mindset: do not build for hypothetical future cases.

✅ Examples of simplicity:
- Prefer composition over inheritance when it simplifies usage.
- Avoid multiple layers of indirection unless essential.
- Favor `foreach` over complex iterator patterns if not needed.

🚫 Avoid:
- Over-generalized abstractions (`BaseFoo`, `AbstractBar`, `*ManagerFactoryFactory`)
- Deep DI graphs with multiple levels of delegation
- Excessive configuration for trivial behavior

💡 Design for clarity first. Optimization or flexibility can come later, if needed.
