description: Apply Fail Fast principle – raise exceptions immediately on error
globs: ["src/**/*.py"]
alwaysApply: true

Always apply the **Fail Fast** principle:

- Detect invalid states, unexpected values, or errors **as early as possible**.
- **Immediately throw a meaningful exception** without deferring or continuing execution with invalid data.
- Never let invalid or missing data propagate through multiple layers of code.
- Always validate method inputs and critical assumptions right after receiving them.
- Avoid complex layers of null checks or defensive programming; trust your methods to either succeed cleanly or fail immediately.

✅ Example:
```python
def get_order_by_id(order_id: int) -> Order:
    order = repository.find(order_id)
    if not order:
        raise OrderNotFoundException(f"Order {order_id} not found")
    return order
```
